As the difficulty of the project starts to grow, you have to start looking for more maintainable solutions...The flutter_bloc package is a reactive and predictable way to manage your app's state. This package takes everything that's awesome about the BLoC (business logic component) pattern and puts it into a simple-to-use library with amazing tooling. After many months of development, the Bloc package has arrived at its first stable version - 1.0.0.",

If you’re a data scientist, and you want to tell the rest of the company, “logo A is better than logo B”, well you can’t just say that without proving it using numbers and statistics. Traditional A/B testing has been around for a long time, and it’s full of approximations and confusing definitions. In this course, while we will do traditional A/B testing in order to appreciate its complexity, what we will eventually get to is the Bayesian machine learning way of doing things.",

        "description": "Keeping your code clean and tested are the two most important development practices. In Flutter, this is even more true than with other frameworks. On one hand, it's nice to hack a quick app together, on the other hand, larger projects start falling apart when you mix the business logic everywhere. Even state management patterns like BLoC are not sufficient in themselves to allow for easily extendable codebase. While the essence of clean architecture remains the same for every framework, the devil lies in the details. Principles like SOLID and YAGNI sound nice, you may even understand what they mean, but it won't do you any good if you don't know how to start writing clean code.",

You could test everything manually by launching the app, using it, and trying your best to make the app blow up with errors. Or you can write a bunch of automated tests, which is arguably a more time-efficient and thorough way to test your apps. Let’s take a look at unit, widget, and integration tests in the video tutorial above.",

I actually covered it with a tutorial quite some time ago when its API was still unstable.Riverpod has come a long way since then - it’s much more mature, helpful, and versatile. All these changes naturally mean that it’s time for a new tutorial to prepare you to fully utilize the power of Riverpod 2.0 and, most likely, also its upcoming versions.",
